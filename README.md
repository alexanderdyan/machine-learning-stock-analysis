# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

Train Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model using pre-COVID-19/historical data to see how well the model compares to what actually happened during COVID-19/current data for the following stocks:

* American Airlines - AAL (travel stock)
* Amazon - AMZN (online shopping - covid beneficiary)
* Bitcoin - BTC
* Chegg - CHGG (online education - covid beneficiary)

* Halliburton - HAL (energy stock)
* Teledoc - TDOC (online doctors visits - covid beneficiary)
* Tesla - TSLA (car/EV/FOMO stock)
